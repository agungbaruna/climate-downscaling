abstract = {Surface wind is significant for ocean state climate, ocean mixing, and viability of wind energy techniques. However, surface wind simulated from the regional climate model generally features substantial bias from observation. For the first time, this study compares the performance of five bias correction techniques, (1) linear scaling, (2) variance scaling, (3) quantile mapping based on empirical distribution, (4) quantile mapping based on Weibull distribution, and (5) cumulative distribution functions transformation, in reducing the statistical bias of a regional climate model wind output, which was downscaled from a global climate model CNRM-CM5 during 1991–2000. The surface wind of JRA55 reanalysis data is used as reference. Results show that all bias correction methods are consistent in reducing the climatological mean bias in spatial patterns and intensities. The linear scaling method always performs the worst among all methods in correcting higher-order statistical biases such as skewness, kurtosis, and wind power density. The other four bias correction methods are generally similar in reducing the statistical biases of different measures based on spatial distribution maps. However, when it comes to spatial averaged mean of statistical measures over CORDEX-East Asia in January and July, the quantile mapping based on Weibull distribution generally shows the best skills among all methods in bias reduction.},
